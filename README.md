# What is this?
This is a basic Kotlin project that is designed to work with VCMP's [Java Plugin](https://forum.vc-mp.org/?topic=2574.0).  
It uses the example script provided [here](https://bitbucket.org/maxorator/vcmp-java-plugin-base/src/a57e2815608ee04d9abfb0c10348409772e9aee6/demo/src/main/com/maxorator/vcmp/java/mode/?at=default), just converted to Kotlin's syntax

# Why is this?
Someone asked me to help them setup Java for their server, so I decided to make this to help others as well :)  

# How to use?
1. Clone this repository  
2. Download dependencies or  
3. Run `./gradlew shadowJar`  
4. By default, the JAR file should be in `./build/libs/`
5. Copy it and paste in your server's root folder.
6. You can use this [configuration example](https://gist.github.com/theKAKAN/c63633ae0a1fa8d583d9fa2e70dd80c4)
7. That's it! Go and play with it now :)
